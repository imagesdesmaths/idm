#+TITLE: IdM --- technical documentation

This documents the /squelette/ of the website at
http://images.math.cnrs.fr/ and complements the documentation there
(which is mainly addressed at article authors and editors --- this one
is full of SPIP and PHP and geek stuff).

* Features added to SPIP

* Code management

This is done in Git, and there are 3 branches to keep track of (plus
temporary ones for experimental features, if needed). That can change if
we end up working in a team but so far:
- =release= is tracking the =zip= files containing the official
  releases of SPIP (including extensions). One commit per version,
  nothing added, nothing removed.
- =spip= is following =release= very closely, merging it whenever it
  is updated, and just contains various tweaks and adaptations for
  easier updates; mostly patches on top of the core system when
  needed, and =.gitignore= configuration.
- =idm= corresponds to the current live code on the website. It merges
  =spip= when a new release appears, or when a bugfix is
  implemented. In principle no file is modified between =spip= and
  =idm=, just new stuff is added (=/squelettes=, =/plugins= etc.).

* Issues

** Urgent

- Allow for several articles per referee [0%]
  - [ ] Do not free a referee completely when an article is published

** In progress

- Podcasts
- Merge =div.plan= and =div.lexique=
- Overhaul of the search engine [33%]
  - [X] Accents, this is done by SPIP3
  - [ ] Sort, classify etc by theme
  - [ ] Automatic article suggestion
- iPhone version [33%]
  - [X] Basic iphone.html
  - [ ] Specific style for small screens (it used to work using
    =max-width=, but apparently that breaks older browsers ...)
  - [ ] Find a way to make login etc. possible
- Fix SVG display on Internet Explorer

** Next

- CC per article
- Loop videos
- Choose the member in the billets team differently
- =squelettes/propose.html=
  - Add an anchor to the forum messages for linking
- =squelettes/navigation.html=
  - should be re-done completely
- Warn a team when a forum message is moderated
- Allow visitors to edit part of their profile

** Back-burner

- Make teams into editorial objects?
- Buttons to write to groups of people
- Filter display by color, possibly merge with ?date=-1year
- Floating picture
- Relecteur occasionnel
- Translation encouragement
- Unify the permissions
- Put =#SPIP_CRON= on specific pages but not on =sommaire.html=
- Use =#HTTP_HEADER= rather than php in =inc/head.php=
- In =formulaires/relecteurs_vote.php=, the SQL update code should be
  elsewhere, the rest should go

** Geekeries and SPIPeries

- In a loop, =#_parent:TITRE=
- Files which are patched versions of upstream (store as a patch for upgrades)
  - =.htaccess= (from =htaccess.txt=)
  - =formulaires/inc-forum_previsu.html=
- Use the =|unique= filter instead of doing it by hand
  - =squelettes/iphone.html=
  - =squelettes/lexique.html=
- Use language strings as much as possible (transfer in passing)
